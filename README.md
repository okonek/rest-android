# rest-android

This is a Android Client for testing Rest HTTP calls.

### Setup for Developers

1.Make sure you have downloaded the latest version of Android Studio. It works
on Linux, Windows and Mac. Download the correct version for your OS

2.Go to the project repo and fork it by clicking "Fork"

3.If you are working on Windows, download Git Bash for Windows to get a full
Unix bash with Git functionality

4.Clone the forked project.

5.Open the project with Android Studio.

### Configure remotes

1.When a repository is cloned, it has a default remote called origin that points
to your fork on GitHub, not the original repository it was forked from. To keep
track of the original repository, you should add another remote named upstream:

2.Open terminal or git bash in your local repository and set up the origin:

3.git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rest-android.git

4.Set the upstream:

5.git remote add upstream https://github.com/jboss-outreach/rest-android.git

6.Run git remote -v to check the status, you should see something like the
following:

origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/powerup-android.git (fetch)

origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/powerup-android.git (push)

upstream https://github.com/systers/powerup-android.git (fetch)

upstream https://github.com/systers/powerup-android.git (push)

7.To update your local copy with remote changes, run the following:

git fetch upstream

git merge upstream/master

8.This will give you an exact copy of the current remote, make sure you don't
have any local changes.

### Contributing and developing a feature

1.Make sure you are in the master branch git checkout master

2.Sync your copy git pull

3.Create a new branch with a meaningful name git checkout -b branch_name

4.Develop your feature on Android Studio and run it using the emulator or
connecting your own Android device

5.Clean your project from Android Studio Build/Clean project

6.Add the files you changed git add file_name (avoid using git add .)

7.Commit your changes git commit -m "Message briefly explaining the feature"

8.Keep one commit per feature. If you forgot to add changes, you can edit the
previous commit git commit --amend

9.Push to your repo git push origin branch-name

10.Go into the Github repo and create a pull request explaining your changes

11.If you are requested to make changes, edit your commit using git commit
--amend, push again and the pull request will edit automatically

12.You will need to add a message on the pull request notifying your changes to
your reviewer
